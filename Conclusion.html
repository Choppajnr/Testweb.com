			<h1>Findings and conclusion</h1>
			<p> have gathered that the average age of the respondents is 18 and this age group is more prone to being victims of privacy loss in smartphones and losing details
			, because stats tell that majority of this age group(teenagers) are prone to blindly accepting terms and conditions of applications and
			cookies of websites without reading what the entail
			, I have discovered this through my investigation and my questionnaire 
			and the stats show that most of this age group do not know the privacy risks concerning privacy
			in smartphones all this contributes to loss of privacy in smartphones.</p>
			<p>In conclusion,
The aim of my investigation was to gather information and gain knowledge on privacy in smartphones and 
the level of knowledge that the people involved in my investigation have on privacy in smartphones and
 the risks that come with using smartphones. I have gathered that people have an adequate amount of knowledge on the risks concerning privacy
 in smartphones and they also know what can be accessed by third parties in the case where
 there is a breach in they’re privacy whilst they are in access of they’re smartphones.
 To conclude it all smartphone privacy is still a major topic of concern and it needs much attention to tackle the issue.
