			<h1>Privacy and the use of smartphones</h1>
			<p>Smartphones are one of the most used devices in the
				World to date, but how many people are actually
				informed about the privacy risks concerning smartphones</p>
			<p>The world is misinformed about the risks concerning smartphones
				for example, how people blatantly accept terms and conditions 
				without reading through them and what they dictate</p>
				<p> A lot of people believe that your smartphone can be turned into a surveillance device without you even realising it. People aren’t at ease because your device can be used as a tracking device by the government, private hackers or cloud service provider.
The focus of the investigation is to investigate whether smartphones are actually safe in the sense of privacy, whether you alone have access to your private information on your phone alone or external sources are able to access your phone without your knowledge and approval
I will investigate by making use of necessary resources like the internet, personal blogs, articles 
My target audience is people who use smartphones and those who aren’t aware of the privacy issues regarding smartphones.</p>
